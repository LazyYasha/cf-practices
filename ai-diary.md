## Summary of Work

*   **Project Setup:** Initialized the repository, created a `src/workers` directory for your source code, and added a "Hello World" Cloudflare worker.
*   **GitHub Actions Workflow:** We created a flexible and secure deployment workflow with the following features:
    *   **Manual Trigger:** The workflow is triggered manually, giving you full control over deployments.
    *   **Customizable Inputs:** You can specify the worker file and application name at the time of deployment.
    *   **Secure Credentials:** Your Cloudflare API token and account ID are managed securely using GitHub repository secrets.
